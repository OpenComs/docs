Similar to ClearCom, OpenComms utilizes a 2-wire interface. The core functionality remains the same, with a main station serving as the central hub for communication and beltpacks acting as portable endpoints for users. The analog system ensures real-time, instantaneous audio transmission, enabling seamless coordination among production teams. Please note that OpenComms is an open-source DIY system, which means it comes with inherent risks. While efforts have been made to ensure its functionality and reliability, it's important to recognize that building and using OpenComms devices involves technical expertise and potential challenges. As with any DIY project, there may be unforeseen issues, compatibility limitations, or potential risks involved. It is recommended to proceed with caution, have a good understanding of the system's components and requirements, and follow proper safety precautions. How does it work The master station / power supply is the central control unit of the system. It provides power to the loop and acts as a \"party-line supervisor,\" controlling the audio levels and preventing feedback and crosstalk. The remote stations are the individual intercom units that are connected to the loop. Each remote station includes a speaker, microphone, and a push-to-talk button. The intercom loop is typically wired in a daisy-chain configuration, with each remote station connected to the loop with a two-conductor cable. The loop can be very long, depending on the number of stations and the cable type. Here is a example: The OpenComms system includes a call signaling feature that allows users to \"page\" other stations on the loop. When a user presses the call button on their remote station, a signal is sent to all other stations on the loop making their LED ring blink, alerting them to the incoming call.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"analog/introduction/#introduction","text":"OpenComms analog system operates on the principles of the widely recognized ClearCom analog partyline infrastructure to provide an open communication solution.

This page aims to provide an in-depth understanding of the inner workings of this intercom system. Loop The loop is a fundamental part of the Opencoms intercom system, responsible for creating a communication pathway between multiple stations and beltpacks. Typically, the loop consists of a daisy-chain connection, where each device is connected in series to form a continuous loop. This ensures that audio signals can pass through each station and beltpack without interruption. Proper termination is crucial to prevent signal reflections and maintain signal integrity. Power supply Opencomms power supplies play a vital role in the intercom system, providing power to the loop and in most cases acting as termination for the line, controlling the audio levels and preventing feedback and crosstalk. The power supplies are designed to supply a clean 24-30VDC between pin 1 (GND) and pin 2 (VCC) . Termination is a critical aspect of setting up a partyline system to ensure optimal performance and signal integrity. In a partyline system, termination is achieved by using termination resistors placed at the end or start of the loop. This resistors is typically arround 200 ohms and connected between pin 1 (GND) throught a capacitor to pin 3 (Signal) . The termination resistors act as loads, absorbing the transmitted audio signal, preventing it from creating feedback loops and ensuring the call signal doesn't last forever. It is important to note that termination is only needed at one device in the loop (typically the power supply), and not at every station or beltpack. Terminating each device individually would result in a degraded performance and lower audio level of the overall system. Remote station Here is an overview of how a basic remote station should work Please be aware that while the principles outlined above are generally applicable to analog partyline remote stations, there may be variations in features and technical details between different models (and/or) manufacturers Call When a call is initiated, it closes a circuit that introduces a DC voltage onto the partyline loop. This DC voltage is superimposed onto the existing audio signal, carrying the call signal information. Receiving stations within the partyline loop detect the presence of this DC voltage. Upon detecting the call signal, the station activate visual indicators, such as LEDs, or audible alerts to notify the users of an incoming call. RMK Sometime, someone leave their beltpacks talk on, this can cause annoyance and other issue, to solve this beltpacks and stations that support it can be restarted remotely by cutting the power very quickly to the intercom line. The power cut needs to by long enought to cause a restart of the stations microcontrollers but short enough to cause a buzz in the audio.","title":"Technical details"},{"location":"analog/technical-details/#technical-details","text":"Welcome to the technical documentation for the Opencomms Analog Partyline System.
